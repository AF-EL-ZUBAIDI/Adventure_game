# Ecosystem Simulation Game: Cataclysm
## Overview
This university project is an advanced Java-based simulation game that models an intricate ecosystem involving various characters, 
animals (both domestic and wild), and environmental dynamics. Named "Cataclysm," the game explores the survival tactics of different entities within
conditions such as forests, jungles, and event-driven scenarios like famine or abundance.

## Key Features

- **Complex Simulation:** Models an ecosystem with detailed interactions among characters, animals, and the environment.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players interact with the game through a character, making decisions that affect their survival and the ecosystem's balance.
- **Dynamic Environments:** Features diverse environments such as forests and jungles, each with unique effects on the game's entities.
- **Adaptive Entities:** Includes a variety of entities with specific behaviors, needs, and interaction capabilities, enhancing the simulation's realism.
- **Event-Driven Scenarios:** The game introduces events like cataclysms that challenge the player and the ecosystem, requiring adaptive strategies for survival.

## Development Experience
This project was envisioned as a group assignment. However, due to limited engagement from team members, the project was undertaken almost solo. 
This situation necessitated comprehensive involvement in all project stages, from conceptualization and system design to coding and debugging. 
The project served as a profound personal and professional development experience, significantly enhancing skills in Java programming, system design, problem-solving, and project management.

## Running the Game
The game is initiated through the `Cataclysm.java` file, serving as the main entry point:

```bash
javac Cataclysm.java
java Cataclysm
```
Follow the in-game prompts to navigate through the simulation, making strategic decisions to ensure your survival and maintain the ecosystem's balance.
